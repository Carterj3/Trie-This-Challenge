# "Trie" This Challenge

Build a simple autocomplete application based on a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure.
 
### Requirements
Create an implementation of a Trie, implementing the algorithms required to support the following interface:
* `add(word)` => adds *word* to the trie, returning `true` if the word was successfully added and `false` if the word was already present.
* `contains(word)` => returns `true` if the trie contains *word* and `false` if it does not.
* `search(prefix)` => returns the list of all words in the trie that begin with *prefix*. 
 
### Guidelines
* The trie implementation only needs to support lowercase words
* Clever solutions are welcome and encouraged
* Implement in a language of your choice
* Include instructions as to how to run your solution
* A User Interface is not required for successful completion of this task (no penalty if you include one, however)

Fork this repository to implement your solution. When you are finished, submit a pull request containing your Trie implementation and any supporting code.
